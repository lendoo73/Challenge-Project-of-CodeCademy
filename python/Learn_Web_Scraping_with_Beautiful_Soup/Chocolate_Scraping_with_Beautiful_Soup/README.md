After eating chocolate bars your whole life, you’ve decided to go on a quest to find the greatest chocolate bar in the world.

You’ve found a website ([Cacao Ratings](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/beautifulsoup/cacao/index.html)) that has over 1700 reviews of chocolate bars from all around the world. 
It’s displayed in the web browser on this page.

The data is displayed in a table, instead of in a `csv` or `json`. 
Thankfully, we have the power of BeautifulSoup that will help us transform this webpage into a DataFrame that we can manipulate and analyze.

The rating scale is from 1-5, as described in [this review guide](http://flavorsofcacao.com/review_guide.html). 
A `1` is “unpleasant” chocolate, while a `5` is a bar that transcends “beyond the ordinary limits”.

Some questions we thought about when we found this dataset were: Where are the best cocoa beans grown? 
Which countries produce the highest-rated bars? 
What’s the relationship between cocoa solids percentage and rating?

Can we find a way to answer these questions, or uncover more questions, using BeautifulSoup and Pandas?
