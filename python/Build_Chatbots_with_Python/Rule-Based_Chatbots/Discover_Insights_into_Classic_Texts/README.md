#### RULE-BASED CHATBOTS
# Discover Insights into Classic Texts

Novels and text contain insights into ideologies and places that are often originally unknown to the reader. By reading a written piece, you uncover the opinions of the author on their chosen topic and come to understand both the topic and how the author thinks.

In this project you will perform a natural language parsing analysis to gain deeper insight into one of two famous and often discussed novels in the public domain: Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray or Homer’s The Iliad! Fear not if you haven’t heard or read the novels, one of the beauties of natural language parsing with regular expressions is the ability to gain insight into lengthy pieces of text without a formal read!
