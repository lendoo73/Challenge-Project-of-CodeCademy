#### Word Embeddings
# [U.S.A. Presidential Vocabulary](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-chatbots-with-python/tracks/retrieval-based-chatbots/modules/nlp-word-embeddings/projects/word-embeddings-presidential)
Whenever a United States of America president is elected or re-elected, an [inauguration ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration) takes place to mark the beginning of the president’s term. During the ceremony, the president gives an inaugural address to the nation, dictating the tone and focus of the next four years of leadership.

In this project you will have the chance to analyze the inaugural addresses of the presidents of the United States of America, as collected by the [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html), using word embeddings.

By training sets of word embeddings on subsets of inaugural address versus the collection of presidents as a whole, we can learn about the different ways in which the presidents use language to convey their agenda.
