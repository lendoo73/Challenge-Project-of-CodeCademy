    "### 15. Create a function to make a transfer between accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "##### step 1. define function\n",
    "Define a function named `acc_transfer()` that accepts five parameters `acc_from`, `acc_to`, `amount`, `checking_balance` and `savings_balance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### step 2. Initialize transaction_status variable\n",
    "Inside the transfer function, start by creating a variable named `transaction_status` and assign it to a an empty string. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### step 3. Initialize an error message\n",
    "On the next line create a variable named `trans_error` and assign it to the value `\"unsuccessful, please enter amount less than \"` \n",
    "\n",
    "##### step 4. Account Transfer\n",
    "Write `if...elif...else` statements. The `if` statement will check if the transfer is from savings to checking account. The `elif` statement will check if the transfer is from checking to savings account. If neither, throw an error in the else statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### step 5. Ensure transfer is less than savings account\n",
    "Within the first `if` statement, write an inner `if...else` that checks if the transfer amount is greater than the savings balance. If the amount is indeed greater, in the else statement, assign `transaction_status` to the variable `trans_error` + `str(savings_balance)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### step 6. Transfer amount from savings to checking account\n",
    "Within the inner `if` statement, subtract `amount` from the `savings_balance` using the `-=` assignment operator. On the next line, add `amount` to the `checking_balance` using the `+=` assignment operator. Then on the next line assign the string value `\"successful\"` to the variable `transaction_status`. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### step 7. Ensure transfer is less than checking account\n",
    "Within the following `elif` statement, write an inner `if...else` that checks if the transfer amount is greater than the checking balance. If the amount is indeed greater, in the else statement, assign `transaction_status` to the variable `trans_error` + `str(checking_balance)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### step 8. Transfer amount from checking to savings  account\n",
    "Within the inner `if` statement, subtract `amount` from the `checking_balance` using the `-=` assignment operator. On the next line, add `amount` to the `savings_balance` using the `+=` assignment operator. Then on the next line assign the string value `\"successful\"` to the variable `transaction_status`. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### step 9. Assign an error statement if there are no matching account_type\n",
    "Within the last `else` statement, assign the string value `\"unsuccessful, please enter \\\"checking\\\" or \\\"savings\\\"\"` to the variable `transaction_status`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### step 10. Create a transfer statement\n",
    "Outside of all the `if` statements but still in the function, compose a statement composing of strings and variables used in this function. Then assign it to the new `transaction_statement` variable. The transfer statement should be; \"Transfer of `amount` from your `cc_from` to your `acc_to` account was `transaction_status`\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##### step 11. Print transfer statement\n",
    "On the next line, write a print statement with the `transaction_statement` as an argument. This will print the transfer statement anytime the transfer function is called. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### step 12. Return savings_balance and checking_balance\n",
    "On the next line return both the `savings_balance` and `checking_balance`. This will conclude the `acc_transfer()` function."
