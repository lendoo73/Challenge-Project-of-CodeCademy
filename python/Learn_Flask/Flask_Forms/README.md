## [Introduction](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-flask/lessons/flask-forms/exercises/introduction)

An important role of websites is gathering information from the user. 
Whether a user is signing into their Codecademy account, ordering clothes online or leaving feedback for a company, web forms have provided a simple way to enter and submit data over the internet.

The use of forms in a site can be an involved process. 
The designer must gather the right information, display the fields in a pleasing manner and ensure the data is collected correctly. 
Over the years this has become easier thanks to frameworks like Flask, which help streamline the process of displaying fields and gathering data.

This lesson assumes a foundational knowledge of web forms and the steps involved in sending the data to the web server. 
In the following exercises we are going to look at how Flask can help gather data from regular web forms as well as create forms in an entirely new way.

## [Flask Request Object](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-flask/lessons/flask-forms/exercises/flask-request-object)

Every time a client communicates with a server it does so through a *request*. 
By default our Flask routes only support GET requests. 
These are requests for data such as what to display in a browser window. 
When submitting a form through a website, the form data is sent as a POST request. 
This type of request wants to add data to the app. 
Routes can handle POST requests if it is specified in the `methods` argument of the `route()` decorator:
```py
@app.route(
  "/", 
  methods = ["GET", "POST"]
)
```
The code above shows a route that now supports both GET and POST requests. 
By default `methods` is set to [“GET”]. 
When adding “POST” to a route’s methods, be sure to include “GET” if you plan for the route to handle those requests as well.

Flask provides access to the data in the request through the `request` object. 
Importing the `request` object allows us to access everything about the requests to our app including form data and the request method such as `GET` or `POST`.
```py
from flask import request
```
When data is sent via a form submission it can be accessed using the `form` attribute of the `request` object. 
The `form` attribute is a dictionary with the form’s field names as the keys and the associated data as the values. 
For example, if a text input had the name "my_text", then the data access would look like this:
```py
text_in_field = request.form["my_text"]
```

## [Route Selection](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-flask/lessons/flask-forms/exercises/route-selection)

As sites get larger and their file structure becomes more complex the paths of Flask routes may change. 
In this case paths that are hard coded into the navigation elements such as hyperlinks and forms may break.

Flask addresses the challenge of expanding file structures with `url_for()`.  
**The function `url_for()` takes a route’s function name as an argument and returns the associated URL path.**   
Given the following Flask route declaration:
```py
@app.route('/')
def index:
```
These two hyperlinks below are identical:
```py
<a href="/">Index Link</a>
 
<a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">Index Link</a>
```
* `url_for()` is inside an expression delimiter {{ }}
* the argument for `url_for()` is inside single quotes
* the entire statement is inside double quotes

**To pass variables** from the template to the app, keyword arguments can be added to `url_for()`. 
They will be sent as arguments attached to the URL. 
It can be accessed the same way as if it was added onto the path manually:
```py
<a href="{{ url_for(
  'my_page', 
  id = 1
) }}">One</a>
```
This line creates a link that sends the value `1` to the route with the function name `my_page`. 
The route can access the variable through `my_id`.
```py
@app.route("/my_path/<int:my_id>"), methods = ["GET", "POST"])
def my_page(my_id):
    # Access flask_name in this function
    new_variable = my_id
    ...
```

## [FlaskForm Class](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-flask/lessons/flask-forms/exercises/flaskform-class)

Flask provides an alternative to web forms by creating a form class in the application, implementing the fields in the template and handling the data back in the application.

A Flask form class inherits from the class `FlaskForm` and includes attributes for every field:
```py
class CommentForm(FlaskForm):
  comment = StringField("Comment")
  submit = SubmitField("Add Comment")
```
This simple class will enable the creation of a form with a text field and a submit button.

The class inherits from the class `FlaskForm` which allows it to implement the form as template variables and then collect the data once submitted. 
`FlaskForm` is a part of [FlaskWTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Access to the fields of this form class is done through the attributes, `my_textfield` and `my_submit`. 
The `StringField` and `SubmitField` classes are the same as `<input type=text...` and `<input type=submit...` respectively and are part of the [WTForms library](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/).

Below is a simple Flask app with the form class.
```py
from flask import Flask, render_template
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, SubmitField
 
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = "my_secret"         # This line is a way to protect against CSRF or Cross-Site Request Forgery.
                                               # CSRF is an attack that used to gain control of a web application.
class MyForm(FlaskForm):
    my_textfield = StringField("TextLabel")
    my_submit = SubmitField("SubmitName")
 
@app.route("/")
def my_route():
    flask_form = MyForm()
    return render_template(
        "my_template", 
        template_form = flask_form
    )
```
In order to use this form in our template, we must create an instance of it and pass it to the template using `render_template()`. 

## [Template Form Variables](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-flask/lessons/flask-forms/exercises/template-form-variables)

Creating a form in the template is done by accessing attributes of the form passed to the template.

Let’s use the following form as we work toward implementing it in a template:
```py
class MyForm(FlaskForm):
    my_textfield = StringField("TextLabel")
    my_submit = SubmitField("SubmitName")
```
In our application route we must instantiate the form and assign that instance to a template variable:
```py
# app.py
my_form = MyForm()
 
return render_template(template_form = my_form)
```
Moving to the template, creating a form we simply use the form class attributes as expressions.
```py
# template.html
<form action="/" method="post">
    {{ template_form.hidden_tag() }}
    {{ template_form.my_textfield.label }}
    {{ template_form.my_textfield() }}
    {{ template_form.my_submit() }}
</form>
```
* Inside the standard `<form>` are all the FlaskForm objects accessed through **`template_form`**.

* **`{{ template_form.hidden_tag() }}`** is the other end of the CSRF protection. 
While not visible in the form, this field handles the necessary tasks to protect from CSRF.
* The next two lines are for the text box. 
  * The first accesses the `label` of the field, which we specified as an argument when we created the field. 
  * The second `my_textfield` line is the input field itself.
* The last line of the form is the submit button. 
Just like the HTML version, this will initiate sending the form data back to the server.

The HTML created from this form implementation is as follows:
```py
<form action="/" method="post">
    <input id="csrf_token" name="csrf_token" type="hidden" value="ImI1YzIxZjUwZWMxNDg0ZDFiODAyZTY5M2U5MGU3MTg2OThkMTJkZjQi.XupI5Q.9HOwqyn3g2pveEHtJMijTu955NU">
    <label for="my_textfield">TextLabel</label>
    <input id="my_textfield" name="my_textfield" type="text" value="">
    <input id="my_submit" name="my_submit" type="submit" value="SubmitName">
</form>
```

## [Handling FlaskForm Data](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-flask/lessons/flask-forms/exercises/handling-flaskform-data)

Once a form is submitted, the data is sent back to the server through a `POST` request. 

Using our FlaskForm class, data is now accessible through the form instance in the Flask app. 
The data can be directly accessed by using the `data` attribute associated with each field in the class:
```py
form_data = flask_form.my_textfield.data
```
Keeping all the information and functionality attached to the form object has streamlined the form creation and data gathering process.

Remember that when a route handles a form it is necessary to add the `POST` method to the route decorator.
```py
@app.route(
  "/recipe/<int:id>", 
  methods = ["GET", "POST"]
)
```

## [Validation](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-flask/lessons/flask-forms/exercises/validation)

In order to submit a form, it is common that certain required text fields must have data, date fields need to have a specific format, or a checkbox agreeing to certain terms needs to be checked.

Validation is when form fields must contain data or a certain format of data in order to move forward with submission. 
We enable validation in our form class using the `validators` parameter in the form field definitions.

Validators come from the `wtform.validators` module. 
Importing the `DataRequired()` validator is accomplished like this:
```py
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired
```
The `DataRequired()` validator simply requires a field to have something in it before the form is submitted. 
Notifying the user that data is required is handled automatically.
```py
comment =  StringField(
  "Comment",
  validators = [DataRequired()]
)
```
The `validators` argument takes a list of validator instances.

The `FlaskForm` class also provides a method called `validate_on_submit()`, which we can used in our route to check for a valid form submission.
```py
if my_form.validate_on_submit():
    # get form data
```
As we saw in second exercise pertaining to the `request` object, in order to avoid gathering data on first access to the route we had to put the data gathering code inside an `if` statement. 
The `validate_on_submit()` function does this exact task.

The `validate_on_submit()` function returns `True` when there is a `POST` request and all the associated form validators are satisfied. 
At this point the data can be gathered and processed. 
When the function returns `False` the route function can move onto other tasks such as rendering the template.

##  [More Form Fields](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-flask/lessons/flask-forms/exercises/more-form-fields)

Let’s look at some additional form fields included in [WTForms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/fields/#basic-fields).

### [TextAreaField](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/fields/#convenience-fields)

The TextAreaField is a text field that supports multi-line input. 
The data returned from a TextAreaField instance is a string that may include more whitespace characters such as newlines or tabs.
```py
# Form class declaration
my_text_area = TextAreaField("Text Area Label")
```

### [BooleanField](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/fields/#basic-fields)

A checkbox element is created using the BooleanField object. 
The data returned from a `BooleanField` instance is either `True` or `False`.
```py
# Form class declaration
my_checkbox = BooleanField("Checkbox Label")
```

### [RadioField](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/fields/#basic-fields)

A radio button group is created using the `RadioField` object. 
Since there are multiple buttons in this group, the instance declaration takes an argument for the group label and a keyword argument `choices` which takes a list of tuples.

Each tuple represents a button in the group and contains the button identifier string and the button label string.
```py
# Form class declaration
my_radio_group = RadioField(
  "Radio Group Label", 
  choices = [
    ("id1", "One"), 
    ("id2","Two"), 
    ("id3","Three")
  ]
)
```
Since the `RadioField()` instance generally contains multiple buttons it is necessary to iterate through it to access the components of the subfields.

## [Redirecting](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-flask/lessons/flask-forms/exercises/redirecting)

Besides rendering templates from our routes, it can be important to move from one route to another. 
This is the role of the function `redirect()`.

Consider the case where we create our form in one route, but after the form submission we want the user to end up in another route. 
While we can set the `action` attribute in the HTML `<form>` tag go to any path, `redirect()` is the best option to move from one route to another.
```py
redirect("url_string")
```
Using this function inside another route will simply send us to the URL we specify. 
In the case of a form submission, we can use `redirect()` after we have processed and saved our data inside our `validate_on_submit()` check.

Why don’t we just render a different template after processing our form data? 
There are many reasons for this, one being that each route comes with its own business logic prior to rendering its template. 
Rendering a template outside the initial route would mean you need to repeat some or all of this code.

Once again, to avoid possible URL string pitfalls, we can utilize `url_for()` within `redirect()`. 
This allows us to navigate routes by specifying the route function name instead of the URL path.
```py
redirect(url_for(
  "new_route", 
  _external = True, 
  _scheme = 'https'
))
```
We must add two new keyword arguments to our call of `url_for()`
The keyword arguments **`_external = True`** and _**`scheme = 'https'`** ensure that the URL we redirect to is a secure HTTPS address and not an insecure HTTP address.

Similarly, regular keyword arguments can be added if necessary:
```py
redirect(url_for(
  "new_route", 
  new_var = this_var, 
  _external = True, 
  _scheme = 'https'
))
```
