#### LINEAR REGRESSION IN PYTHON

# [Algerian Forest Fires](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/linear-regression-mssp/projects/algerian-forest-fires)

In this project, you’ll examine the forests dataset that includes variables on weather and fire risk for locations in Algerian forests from two different regions. 
By plotting and running multiple linear regressions, you’ll explore the relationships among variables including:
* `temp` – maximum temperature in degrees Celsius
* `humid` – relative humidity as a percentage
* `region` – location in `Bejaia` in the northeast of Algeria or `Sidi Bel-abbes` in the northwest of Algeria
* `fire` – whether a fire occurred (`True`) or didn’t (`False`)
* `FFMC` – Fine Fuel Moisture Code: measure of forest litter fuel moisture that incorporates temperature, humidity, wind, and rain
* `ISI` – Initial Spread Index: estimates spread potential of fire
* `BUI` – Buildup Index: estimates potential release of heat
* `FWI` – Fire Weather Index: measure of general fire intensity potential that incorporates ISI and BUI

The dataset is a subset of data that was downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Algerian+Forest+Fires+Dataset++) 
and then cleaned for analysis.
