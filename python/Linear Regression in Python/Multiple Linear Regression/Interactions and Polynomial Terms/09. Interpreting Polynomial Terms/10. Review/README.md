#### INTERACTIONS AND POLYNOMIAL TERMS

# [Review](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/linear-regression-mssp/lessons/stats-interactions-and-polynomial-terms-in-multiple-regression/exercises/review)

Congratulations! You have now learned:
1. We need interaction and polynomial terms for more complex situations.
2. How to fit and interpret interaction terms for a binary predictor with a quantitative predictor.
3. How to fit and interpret interaction terms for two quantitative predictors.
4. How to fit and interpret polynomial terms.

One final note: You may be wondering how we can be adding multiplied and squared terms and still consider our models to be linear in nature. 
Although we can add interaction and polynomial terms to a multiple regression model, 
the model is still considered a multiple LINEAR regression model because the COEFFICIENTS themselves are not raised to higher powers or multiplied by one another.

In other words, the model does not consider the polynomial or interaction terms any differently than any other variable; 
when we add an interaction or polynomial term, it’s like we’re just adding another predictor to the model that happens to be a composite of some of the other predictors.
