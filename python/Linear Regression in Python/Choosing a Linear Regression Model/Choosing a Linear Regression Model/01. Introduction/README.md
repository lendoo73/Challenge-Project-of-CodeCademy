#### CHOOSING A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL

# [Introduction](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/linear-regression-mssp/lessons/choosing-a-linear-regression-model/exercises/introduction)

In this lesson, weâ€™ll discuss some of the ways we can compare and choose linear regression models using a variety of different methods.

For example, suppose that we work at a bike rental company and have a dataset where each row represents a unique day of business 
(including info about the number of bikes that were rented, the weather, the day of the week, etc.). 
We might want to use this dataset to predict how many bikes will be rented tomorrow (so we can plan). 
Alternatively, we might want to use the dataset to understand which factors are most predictive of bike usage.

For either goal, we can use a linear regression model. 
The problem is: there are many different models that we could create. 
How do we know which one to use?

This lesson will focus on some common ways to compare and choose a linear model, both for prediction and data analysis.
