#### CHOOSING A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL

# [R-Squared](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/linear-regression-mssp/lessons/choosing-a-linear-regression-model/exercises/r-squared)

R-squared is one of the most common metrics to evaluate linear regression models. 
We can interpret **R-squared** as ***the proportion of variation in an outcome variable*** that is explained by a linear regression model. 
More explained variation is generally better.

For example, suppose we have a dataset containing information about apartment rentals for NYC apartments. 
We can build two different models to predict rental price and print out the R-Squared for each model as follows:
```py
# Create and fit the first model to predict rent
model1 = sm.OLS.from_formula(
    'rent ~ bedrooms + size_sqft + min_to_subway', 
    data = rentals
).fit()
 
# Create and fit the second model
model2 = sm.OLS.from_formula(
    'rent ~ bathrooms + building_age_yrs + borough', 
    data = rentals
).fit()
 
# Print out R-squared for both models
print(model1.rsquared) #Output: 0.664
print(model2.rsquared) #Output: 0.596
```
This tells us that the first model (using bedrooms, square-footage, and minutes to the subway) explains about 66.4% of the variation in rental prices, 
whereas the second model only explains about 59.6% of the variation. 
This would lead us to choose the first model over the second.
