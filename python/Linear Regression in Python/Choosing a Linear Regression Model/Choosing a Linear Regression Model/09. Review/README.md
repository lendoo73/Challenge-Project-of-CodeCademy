#### CHOOSING A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL

# [Review](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/linear-regression-mssp/lessons/choosing-a-linear-regression-model/exercises/review)

Congratulations! In this lesson, you’ve learned a number of different methods for model comparison:
* For choosing a model that best represents the data we have:
    * R-squared
    * Adjusted R-squared
    * F-test
* For choosing a model for accurate out-of-sample prediction:
    * Log likelihood
    * AIC/BIC
    * Training/test sets

Note that we’ve covered many different methods for choosing a model and they don’t always agree. 
In order to choose a method, it’s important to consider your ultimate goal (analysis vs. prediction) 
and what you want to prioritize (simplicity and interpretability vs. accuracy)
