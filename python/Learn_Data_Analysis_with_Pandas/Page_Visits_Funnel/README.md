# [Page Visits Funnel](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/data-processing-pandas/projects/multi-tables-proj)

Cool T-Shirts Inc. has asked you to analyze data on visits to their website. 
Your job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.

In this case, our funnel is going to describe the following process:
1. A user visits CoolTShirts.com
2. A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
3. A user clicks “checkout”
4. A user actually purchases a t-shirt
