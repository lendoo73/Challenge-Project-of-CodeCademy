#### INTRODUCTION TO DJANGO

# [Fortune Teller](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-python-web-apps-with-django/tracks/introduction-to-django/modules/introduction-to-django/projects/django-fortune-teller)

Let’s build a Fortune Telling web app!

It’s always nice to get a random positive message to brighten up our day. 
We can use our newfound Django skills to make a website just for that! 
In this project, we will build a Django project from scratch using the MTV pattern. 
Whenever our website is loaded, Django will call on a view function to select a random fortune from a list and populate a template to send back to the client.

We’ll start with an empty workspace and build out our fortuneteller project step by step.
