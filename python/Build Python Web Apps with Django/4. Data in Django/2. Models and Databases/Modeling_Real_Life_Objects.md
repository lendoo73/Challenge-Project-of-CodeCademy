# [Modeling Real Life Objects](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-python-web-apps-with-django/tracks/data-in-django/modules/django-models-and-databases/informationals/django-modeling-real-life-objects)

This module will showcase how Django uses models to represent real-life data and how to set up a database.

One big reason we make apps is to solve real-life problems. 
To do so, we need to use information that maps closely to real life as well!

Django addresses this issue by using models. 
Models are how real-life objects get represented in a Django application. 
Then to store this information, we need a database. 
Conveniently, Django recognizes how common of an issue this is for developers and has a system set up for us to use.
