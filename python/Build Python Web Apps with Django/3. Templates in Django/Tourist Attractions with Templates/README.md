#### TEMPLATES IN DJANGO

# [Tourist Attractions with Templates](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-python-web-apps-with-django/tracks/templates-in-django/modules/django-templates/projects/django-tourist-attractions-with-templates)

You’ll be creating an application that allows for users to see a list of tourist attractions in each state. 
Users can also specify the state that they want to see more detailed attractions with as well. 
You’ll be creating the templates for this website, meaning that you’ll be creating everything the users see using Django!

This will be done using the knowledge gained from the templates lesson, including extending off of base templates, adding static files, 
and adding filters to variables being used within the template!
