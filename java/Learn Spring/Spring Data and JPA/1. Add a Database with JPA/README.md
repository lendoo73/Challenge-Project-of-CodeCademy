#### ADD A DATABASE WITH JPA

# [What is Spring Data JPA?](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-spring/lessons/add-a-database-with-jpa/exercises/what-is-spring-data-jpa)

Spring Data JPA is a library for Spring that helps to integrate a database into your REST API.

In this lesson, we will create an application that will help a botanist keep track of their inventory of plants.

Our database will store information about different plants, how many of them the botanist has, and how often they need to be watered to stay healthy.

Your Spring Boot application will wrap around this database, helping us manage the botanistâ€™s inventory with simple REST calls.
